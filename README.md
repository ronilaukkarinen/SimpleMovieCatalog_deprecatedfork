**webapp2**-template is currently the most complete template with latest SCSS.

More Template screenshots can be found in [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/1960711/Simple-Movie-Catalog), but those are fully deprecated and never intended in production. Don't ask for them, they do not exist in working versions.

Themes included:
- Old
- White
- Black
- Webapp
- Webapp2

### [Official demo](http://smoviecat.sourceforge.net/demo/catalog.html)

## How to use

1. [Download latest version](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/SimpleMovieCatalog/archive/master.zip) and unpack it or git clone this repo to your home directory
2. Fill out config.txt, like this:

````
/path/to/your/video/files

-theme webapp2
-skip sample cover folder sub
-ext avi mkv nfo
-matchfirst
-origtitle
-nosubs
-nolink
````

3. Add bash-alias, open `~/.bashrc` and add (edit path to home and public): `alias catalog_movies='rm -rf ~/SimpleMovieCatalog/imdb_cache && perl /home/user/SimpleMovieCatalog/moviecat.pl -v -o /var/www/html/movies/index -c /home/user/SimpleMovieCatalog/config.txt && cd /var/www/html/leffat && iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 index.html > index.html2 && rm index.html && mv index.html2 index.html'`, then reload new settings with `. ~/.bashrc`
4. Run `catalog_movies` and browse to your webserver subdirectory. If you don't like it to be public you can just edit -o directory or or it could be a good idea to set up .htpasswd in public directory. Optionally you could add command to crontab for example to catalog movies every night.

The official documentation starts below.

## Simple Movie Catalog 2.0.2-fork

Copyright (C) 2008-2016 damien.langg@gmail.com

Simple Movie Catalog will scan a given directory for movies, query imdb for info and generate a catalog in html which offers sorting and grouping of found movies by different criteria.

## Install:

### Windows:

   1. Install Perl
      Simple Movie Catalog is written in perl so you'll have to install it first.
      Download from: http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/
      or from: http://strawberryperl.com/
      or install cygwin, which includes perl (http://www.cygwin.com/)
      Make sure to have perl in PATH!

   2. Install Simple Movie Catalog
      Download SimpleMovieCatalog.zip and unpack to a directory of your liking.
      (example: C:\Program Files\SimpleMovieCatalog)

   3. Run
      Drag&drop a directory to run_scan.cmd or edit config.txt and start run_scan.cmd
      The directory will be scanned, html report generated and opened using your
      favorite web browser.

* Linux / BSD / Mac OS X:

      Unpack, edit config.txt and run:
      $ `perl moviecat.pl -c config.txt`
      Open report/movies.html with your favorite browser.

      Note: the packaged text files are in msdos format.
      Convert them to unix format with:
      $ `dos2unix *.txt doc/*.txt`



## Usage:

The directories are scanned for: *.nfo, *.txt, *.url, *.desktop files that
contain links to imdb info like this: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/

If no such link is present then the movie title and year is guessed from
directory or file name and searched on imdb for an exact match.

If none of the above methods produce valid info, then the directory is
reported in the "Missing Info" group.

You can then resolve missing info for these directories by using one of
the following methods:

 - Find the movie on imdb and then drag&drop the link from your
   browser location bar to the directory containing the movie.
   This will create a .url file (.desktop on linux) in that directory.

 - To make guessing work better rename the directory to use the format:
   "Title (Year) [optional additional info]"
   Guessing will only use Title and Year. Year is mandatory and anything
   following year is ignored.

 - Try playing with some options to relax the search:
        -my (search also if missing year in dir or file name)
        -mf (match first if multiple results)
        -aka (match AKA titles - in other language than original).
   The matching will not be so strict so you might get more hits,
   but the results might not be as accurate.

 - Manually create a .nfo or .txt file in the directory and put
   the imdb link inside.

 - Use the interactive mode to search and assign movies to directories.

 - Or choose to ignore the directory by using the -ignore or -skip options
   or using the ignoredir command in interactive mode.

After the info is added you need to re-run the scan to update the html report.

All imdb queries are cached for 30 days in imdb_cache directory so running scan
multiple times is fast.

Option Notes:

  User Votes:

    -user VOTES_URL         Add user's votes from imdb user's vote history url

    VOTES_URL has the following format: [Name=]{URL|ID|FILE}
    Examples:
        -user http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=12345678
        -user 12345678
        -user Johnny=12345678
        -user George=myvotes.html


  Movie Tags:

    -tag NAME=PATTERN       Add a tag NAME if path matches PATTERN

    Movies can be assigned some tags, which allow additional filtering.
    Tags are assigned based on:
    - path matching (HiDef)
    - imdb movie type (TV,Video,Series)
    - movie match method (Guess)
    In a way, path matching tags are similar to groups, but
    offer more flexible filtering.

    Examples:
        -tag Seen=seen
        -tag Downloads=/Downloads/
    Multiple patterns can be specified, separated with comma, example:
        -tag HiDef=hidef,720,1080
    Note: HiDef tag is already predefined, to disable it assign it
    an empty PATTERN. Example:
        -tag HiDef=
    To add patterns to an existing tag, use += instead of = example:
        -tag HiDef+=hddvd
    Note: NAME must not contain any spaces or commas (,).


  Subtitles and Links:

    -subs URL               Add subtitle search site
    -link URL               Add a custom link

    The following patterns can be used in the URL:
        %ID%    -   Movie ID
        %TITLE% -   Movie Title
        %YEAR%  -   Movie Year
    And a custom name can be specified like this: NAME=URL

    Examples:
        -subs http://www.subtitlesource.org/title/tt%ID%
        -subs http://divxtitles.com/%TITLE%/English/any/1
        -link Trailers=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt%ID%/trailers
        -link http://www.google.com/search?q=%TITLE%
        -link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=%TITLE%

  Themes:
    -theme <NAME> option will select the default theme
    A new theme can be added to lib/name.css
````

Config File:
============

All command line options can be used in a config file.
Use only one option per line, followed by optional arguments in same line.
Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
Multimple config files can be specified or nested, so you can include the
ignore list generated by the interactive ignoredir commad with:
"-c ignore.txt" from the command line or from the config file.
See doc/sample-cfg.txt for an example.



Interactive Mode:
=================

Start with -i option or run interactive.cmd to enter interactive mode.
In interactive mode, you can assign movies to directories which are missing
info (either missing a .nfo file or guessing didn't give an exact match).

Brief help on interactive commands:

TITLE (YEAR)    -  Search by TITLE [(YEAR) optional]
s TITLE (YEAR)  -  Search by TITLE [(YEAR) optional]
ID              -  Specify IMDB ID
URL             -  Specify IMDB URL

l / ll          -  List relevant / all files
d / dd          -  List dirs (missing info / all)
dir             -  List sub-dirs to current dir
cd N/DIR        -  Change to dir number(N) / name(DIR)
<enter>         -  Next dir with missing info
n / p           -  Next / Previous dir
pwd             -  Print Current Dir

!CMD            -  Run command CMD in dir
r               -  Recreate Report
? / h / help    -  Print Help
q / quit        -  Quit



The Catalog Page:
=================

The created catalog is an interactive html + javascript page, which lists
all the found movies and offers sorting and filtering of them. The interface
should mostly be self explaining and intuitive, but here are a few details
worth mentioning:

Tag filtering:

Each tag can be in one of the 3 states: "all", "not", "selected".
 - "all" state: no filtering is done for this specific tag,
    so all movies are shown regardles if they contain the tag or not.
 - "not" state: only movies that don't contain the tag are matched and shown.
 - "selected" state: only movies that contain the tag are matched and shown.

This logic is then applied for each tag, and the intersection of movies
that match the set tag states is shown.

Genre filtering:

The genre filtering behaves in two different ways, depending if more than half or
less than half of the genres are selected.
- less than half genres selected:
  All movies that contain at least one of the selected genre is matched and shown.
- more than half genres selected:
  Only movies whose all genres are selected are matched. In other words,
  movie that contains an unselected genre is not shown.
Example:
- Only "Comdey" is selected: all movies that contain comedy are shown.
- Everything but "Comedy" selected: all movies except those that
  contain comedy are shown.

To quickly select just one genre, you can just click on the genre name.
